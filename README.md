Project Steps:
- Find optimal portfolio weights
- simulate into the future, using a multitude of stochastic processes
- Find new optimal weights
- Define set of options
- Add options to optimization model
- Sharpe Ratios
- Compare results of future simulation to portfolio performance in reality
- Explore addition of ML to Data
- Explore addition of stochastic interest rates
